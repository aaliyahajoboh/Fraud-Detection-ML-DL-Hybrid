#  Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## Description:
This repository contains the code and analysis for my Master's degree project on fraud detection in financial transactions. The project focuses on leveraging machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to detect fraudulent transactions in financial datasets.

## Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop robust models capable of identifying fraudulent activities in financial transactions, thereby helping financial institutions mitigate risks and protect their assets.

## Dataset:
The analysis utilizes a dataset containing various features such as transaction type, amount, and other relevant attributes. The dataset is explored, preprocessed, and analyzed to understand the characteristics of fraudulent transactions.

## Approach:

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Initial exploration and visualization of the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of features and identify patterns.
* **Preprocessing:** Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and balancing the dataset to address class imbalance.
* **Modeling:** 
  * Traditional Machine Learning Models: Utilized algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression to establish a baseline.
  * Deep Learning Models: Employed various architectures such as Feedforward Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for comprehensive analysis.
  * Hybrid Model: Integrated a Voting Classifier combining multiple models for improved accuracy and robustness.
* **Model Evaluation:** Assessed models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC curves to evaluate performance comprehensively.ML models including Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and DL models such as Feedforward Neural Network, LSTM, and Bidirectional LSTM are trained and evaluated.

## Outcome:
The project offers comprehensive insights into the performance of various ML and DL models for detecting fraudulent transactions. Through detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations, the efficacy of different approaches is compared. The culmination of the project is a robust fraud detection system capable of accurately identifying fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives. By integrating both traditional machine learning and deep learning models, the system demonstrates enhanced performance and reliability, thereby contributing to improved risk management and financial security.

## Tools and Techniques:

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Keras, TensorFlow.

**Techniques:** Data preprocessing, Feature engineering, Model selection and tuning, Imbalanced data handling, Ensemble methods, Deep learning architectures.


## Conclusion:
The findings from this project can assist financial institutions in implementing effective fraud detection systems to safeguard against financial losses and maintain trust with their customers.
